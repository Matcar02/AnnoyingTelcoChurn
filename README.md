# AnnoyingTelcoChurn
The repository contains some of the work done by me and 4 colleagues for a university project of the "data analysis for business" class. The work focuses on identifying recurrent churn clients as well as defining the root causes for churning.
The dataset used is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.
Hope you enjoy!
