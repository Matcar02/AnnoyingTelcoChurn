# AnnoyingTelcoChurn
The repository contains some of the work done by me and 4 colleagues for a university project of the "data analysis for business" class. The work focuses on identifying recurrent churn clients as well as defining the root causes for churning. The project has been divided into sections that can be better visualized using a markdown interpreter such as RSTUDIO.

The dataset used is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. You can find both the markdown which includes all the relevant code to accomplish the project as well as the compiled PDF version including only some findings.
Hope you enjoy!
